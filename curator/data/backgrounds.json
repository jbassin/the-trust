      "<p>Hao Jin really has some nerve for a supposed disciple of Abadar. First, she dares to start a collection of trinkets in hopes of emulating the great Abadar's unsurpassable First Vault. As if that weren't enough, she also sets up a contest to give away her most powerful treasures to anyone who can throw a punch! Abadar hasn't directly told you as much, per se, but surely this kind of hubris can't sit well with your beloved deity, regardless of Hao Jin's own supposed ties to the Master of the First Vault. At the very least, someone's got to check out this shoddy imitation of the First Vault and write a report for the church of Abadar - and you've decided that someone is you.</p>\n<p>With or without the blessing of an actual priest of Abadar, you've taken it upon yourself to investigate Hao Jin's \"wondrous\" vault by winning her Ruby Phoenix Tournament. You read a few flyers about the tournament's home city and joined the first team that could handle your righteous zealotry, but any more preparation would be a waste of time. You clearly have the divine will of Abadar on your side (but again, no actual proof of this), which is all you'll need to win this tournament and dispel any notions of Hao Jin's ties to your patron deity.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts.

Your future seemed bright, and you predicted that it was only a matter of time until you ascended to the rank of primary cog or, someday, grand cog.</p>\n<p>Then, your years of devout service were undone in an instant. A man named Ambrost Mugland came to the Temple and demanded not only access to the religious formulas you'd been uncovering, but exclusive rights to the precious knowledge. When you refused, Mugland sent word to the church's leaders that you'd been meddling in heretical doctrine. He also implicated you in the theft of church funds that had mysteriously gone missing as of late. Sure enough, you found yourself being asked to hand in your robes. Your church colleagues didn't turn you in, but they told you in no uncertain terms that you wouldn't be able to find sanctuary for your alleged crimes in the halls of the Temple of Brigh.</p>\n<p>On the run and with nowhere to turn, your faith has been thoroughly tested, though so far you've remained true to your religion and maintained your sacred skills and divine powers. It's unclear what the Bronze Lady has in store for you, but at least one thing's for certain: Ambrost Mugland will pay for what he did.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts.

      "<p>Gaining admission to Blythir College is a difficult task, even for Alkenstar's most well-to-do families. In the magic-warped Mana Wastes, it's next to impossible to fake arcane talents or alchemical aptitude. So when you were accepted to the school, it was one of the most triumphant moments of your life.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, your victory was short-lived. Just as you were you making significant headway on a promising series of explosive experiments, you found a letter on your desk informing you that, effective immediately, you were permanently expelled from Blythir College. As bogus as the punishment was, the charges leveled against you were even more puzzling: theft of property, both intellectual and physical. And just like that, you found your prestigious honors replaced with a ruined reputation, and your colleagues and mentors became bitter rivals and accusers. In an instant, you'd gone from promising scholar to wanted criminal.</p>\n<p>You followed the money for answers and learned that a shady financier named Ambrost Mugland didn't want you to finish your research at Blythir. He'd learned that you were on the brink of a great discovery-one that even you weren't fully aware of-and he decided that your imminent breakthrough would be bad for business. Unfortunately for Mugland, he chose the wrong student to destroy. Now, you'll do whatever's necessary to get your revenge on the villain who stole the future you had worked so hard to build for yourself.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts.

Thanks to your strict upbringing and the connections of your family, you soon became a lauded and highly respected member of Absalom's political elite. But you couldn't stifle a certain feeling that you were destined for more than simply filling the pointed shoes of your forebears. Despite your easily earned accolades and a relatively cushy life as a young lawyer or councilmember, you sought to do more with your diplomatic training and not live out the exact same life as your ancestors.</p>\n<p>Your decision to transfer to the Edgewatch has rubbed your traditionalist family the wrong way, and they've cut off the financial aid they've provided you your whole life.

Even while on duty, you're probably idly fiddling with a lucky coin or practicing magic tricks with a deck of cards.

      "<p>Have you heard of the peerless sorcerer Hao Jin, also known as the Ruby Phoenix? Of course you have! You're her biggest fan! She's got amazing powers of self-resurrection, her hair is as red and fiery as a phoenix, and she has a huge vault full of the most incredible treasures in the multiverse. Now she's finally back from a mysterious 300-year quest on the plane of Axis so she can host this year's Ruby Phoenix Tournament—and you can't wait to meet her! In order to get as close to Hao Jin as possible, you've researched everything there is to know about the Ruby Phoenix's home, her planar escapades, and her competition. You've also trained your body to prove yourself a worthy champion. When Hao Jin's committee invited you and some friends to take part in the tournament's prequalifier, you just about fainted from excitement. Is your dream of meeting the Ruby Phoenix about to come true? As long as you win enough matches to get into the actual tournament, it just might! Just try not to act too star-struck when you finally get a chance to talk to her, okay?</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts.

Luckily, a chance invitation promised good work for someone with your unique social talents. You went to an inconspicuous chamber in a humble tower somewhere in the Capital District. There, you met some clearly powerful, clearly corrupt members of the Alkenstar elite. Among the faces you recognized were the notorious mogul Ambrost Mugland and the steely-eyed shieldmarshal Anjelique Loveless. Before you were asked to leave, you made quite an impression-but not a good one.</p>\n<p>Not only did you not make the cut for whatever kinds of jobs were on offer that day, but you soon discovered that you couldn't get a room at any inn in the city, and there were wanted posters with your name on them plastered all over town. Friends and families turned their backs on you, afraid to get involved. Clearly, someone at that meeting-Mugland, maybe, or perhaps Loveless- believed you were a liability, and they had you excised from Alkenstar society. All you want is to be able to walk the streets without fearing for your life, and there's only one way to make that happen: find the villains responsible for your predicament and get them to undo the curse now attached to your name.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts.
