      "<p>You can use a skill-typically Crafting, Lore, or Performance-to earn money during downtime. You must be trained in the skill to do so. This takes time to set up, and your income depends on your proficiency rank and how lucrative a task you can find. Because this process requires a significant amount of time and involves tracking things outside the progress of adventures, it won't come up in every campaign.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the GM might let you use a different skill to Earn Income through specialized work. Usually, this is scholarly work, such as using Religion in a monastery to study old texts-but giving sermons at a church would still fall under Performance instead of Religion. You also might be able to use physical skills to make money, such as using Acrobatics to perform feats in a circus or Thievery to pick pockets. If you're using a skill other than Crafting, Lore, or Performance, the DC tends to be significantly higher.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Uses</h2>\n<p><strong>Crafting</strong> Earn Income by crafting goods for the market.</p>\n<p><strong>Lore</strong> Earn Income by using your knowledge to practice a trade.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance</strong> Earn Income by staging a performance.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Earn Income</h2>\n<p><span class=\"trait\" title=\"An activity with this trait takes a day or more, and can be used only during downtime.\">Downtime</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p>You use one of your skills to make money during downtime. The GM assigns a task level representing the most lucrative job available. You can search for lower-level tasks, with the GM determining whether you find any. Sometimes you can attempt to find better work than the initial offerings, though this takes time and requires using the Diplomacy skill to Gather Information, doing some research, or socializing.</p>\n<p>When you take on a job, the GM secretly sets the DC of your skill check. After your first day of work, you roll to determine your earnings. You gain an amount of income based on your result, the task's level, and your proficiency rank (as listed on Table 4-2: Income Earned).</p>\n<p>You can continue working at the task on subsequent days without needing to roll again. For each day you spend after the first, you earn the same amount as the first day, up until the task's completion. The GM determines how long you can work at the task. Most tasks last a week or two, though some can take months or even years.</p>\n<h2>Table 4-2: Income Earned</h2>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Task Level</th>\n<th>Failed</th>\n<th>Trained</th>\n<th>Expert</th>\n<th>Master</th>\n<th>Legendary</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1 cp</td>\n<td>5 cp</td>\n<td>5 cp</td>\n<td>5 cp</td>\n<td>5 cp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2 cp</td>\n<td>2 sp</td>\n<td>2 sp</td>\n<td>2 sp</td>\n<td>2 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>4 cp</td>\n<td>3 sp</td>\n<td>3 sp</td>\n<td>3 sp</td>\n<td>3 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>8 cp</td>\n<td>5 sp</td>\n<td>5 sp</td>\n<td>5 sp</td>\n<td>5 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1 sp</td>\n<td>7 sp</td>\n<td>8 sp</td>\n<td>8 sp</td>\n<td>8 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2 sp</td>\n<td>9 sp</td>\n<td>1 gp</td>\n<td>1 gp</td>\n<td>1 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>3 sp</td>\n<td>1 gp, 5 sp</td>\n<td>2 gp</td>\n<td>2 gp</td>\n<td>2 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>4 sp</td>\n<td>2 gp</td>\n<td>2 gp, 5 sp</td>\n<td>2 gp, 5 sp</td>\n<td>2 gp, 5 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5 sp</td>\n<td>2 gp, 5 sp</td>\n<td>3 gp</td>\n<td>3 gp</td>\n<td>3 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>6 sp</td>\n<td>3 gp</td>\n<td>4 gp</td>\n<td>4 gp</td>\n<td>4 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>7 sp</td>\n<td>4 gp</td>\n<td>5 gp</td>\n<td>6 gp</td>\n<td>6 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>8 sp</td>\n<td>5 gp</td>\n<td>6 gp</td>\n<td>8 gp</td>\n<td>8 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>9 sp</td>\n<td>6 gp</td>\n<td>8 gp</td>\n<td>10 gp</td>\n<td>10 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>1 gp</td>\n<td>7 gp</td>\n<td>10 gp</td>\n<td>15 gp</td>\n<td>15 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>1 gp, 5 sp</td>\n<td>8 gp</td>\n<td>15 gp</td>\n<td>20 gp</td>\n<td>20 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>2 gp</td>\n<td>10 gp</td>\n<td>20 gp</td>\n<td>28 gp</td>\n<td>28 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>2 gp, 5 sp</td>\n<td>13 gp</td>\n<td>25 gp</td>\n<td>36 gp</td>\n<td>40 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>3 gp</td>\n<td>15 gp</td>\n<td>30 gp</td>\n<td>45 gp</td>\n<td>55 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>4 gp</td>\n<td>20 gp</td>\n<td>45 gp</td>\n<td>70 gp</td>\n<td>90 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>6 gp</td>\n<td>30 gp</td>\n<td>60 gp</td>\n<td>100 gp</td>\n<td>130 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>8 gp</td>\n<td>40 gp</td>\n<td>75 gp</td>\n<td>150 gp</td>\n<td>200 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20 (critical success)</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>50 gp</td>\n<td>90 gp</td>\n<td>175 gp</td>\n<td>300 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You do outstanding work.

Gain the amount of currency listed in the failure column for the task level. The GM will likely reduce how long you can continue at the task.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You earn nothing for your work and are fired immediately. You can't continue at the task. Your reputation suffers, potentially making it difficult for you to find rewarding jobs in that community in the future.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Sample Earn Income Tasks</h2>\n<p>These examples use Alcohol Lore to work in a bar or Legal Lore to perform legal work.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trained</strong> bartend, do legal research</li>\n<li><strong>Expert</strong> curate drink selection, present minor court cases</li>\n<li><strong>Master</strong> run a large brewery, present important court cases</li>\n<li><strong>Legendary</strong> run an international brewing franchise, present a case in Hell's courts</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Crafting Goods for the Market [Crafting]</h2>\n<p>Using Crafting, you can work at producing common items for the market. It's usually easy to find work making basic items whose level is 1 or 2 below your settlement's level. Higher-level tasks represent special commissions, which might require you to Craft a specific item using the Craft downtime activity and sell it to a buyer at full price. These opportunities don't occur as often and might have special requirements-or serious consequences if you disappoint a prominent client.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Practicing a Trade [Lore]</h2>\n<p>You apply the practical benefits of one of your Lore specialties during downtime by practicing your trade. This is most effective for Lore specialties such as business, law, or sailing, where there's high demand for workers. The GM might increase the DC or determine only low-level tasks are available if you're attempting to use an obscure Lore skill to Earn Income. You might also need specialized tools to accept a job, like mining tools to work in a mine or a merchant's scale to buy and sell valuables in a market.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Staging a Performance [Performance]</h2>\n<p>You perform for an audience to make money. The available audiences determine the level of your task, since more discerning audiences are harder to impress but provide a bigger payout. The GM determines the task level based on the audiences available. Performing for a typical audience of commoners on the street is a level 0 task, but a performance for a group of artisans with more refined tastes might be a 2nd- or 3rd-level task, and ones for merchants, nobility, and royalty are increasingly higher level. Your degree of success determines whether you moved your audience and whether you were rewarded with applause or rotten fruit.</p>",

      "<p>Retraining offers a way to alter some of your character choices, which is helpful when you want to take your character in a new direction or change decisions that didn't meet your expectations. You can retrain feats, skills, and some selectable class features. You can't retrain your ancestry, heritage, background, class, or ability scores. You can't perform other downtime activities while retraining.</p>\n<p>Retraining usually requires you to spend time learning from a teacher, whether that entails physical training, studying at a library, or falling into shared magical trances. Your GM determines whether you can get proper training or whether something can be retrained at all. In some cases, you'll have to pay your instructor.</p>\n<p>Some abilities can be difficult or impossible to retrain (for instance, a sorcerer can retrain their bloodline only in extraordinary circumstances).</p>\n<p>When retraining, you generally can't make choices you couldn't make when you selected the original option. For instance, you can't exchange a 2nd-level skill feat for a 4th-level one, or for one that requires prerequisites you didn't meet at the time you took the original feat. If you don't remember whether you met the prerequisites at the time, ask your GM to make the call. If you cease to meet the prerequisites for an ability due to retraining, you can't use that ability. You might need to retrain several abilities in sequence in order to get all the abilities you want.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Feats</h2>\n<p>You can spend a week of downtime retraining to swap out one of your feats. Remove the old feat and replace it with another of the same type. For example, you could swap a skill feat for another skill feat, but not for a wizard feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skills</h2>\n<p>You can spend a week of downtime retraining to swap out one of your skill increases. Reduce your proficiency rank in the skill losing its increase by one step and increase your proficiency rank in another skill by one step. The new proficiency rank has to be equal to or lower than the proficiency rank you traded away. For instance, if your bard is a master in Performance and Stealth, and an expert in Occultism, you could reduce the character's proficiency in Stealth to expert and become a master in Occultism, but you couldn't reassign that skill increase to become legendary in Performance. Keep track of your level when you reassign skill increases; the level at which your skill proficiencies changed can influence your ability to retrain feats with skill prerequisites.</p>\n<p>You can also spend a week to retrain an initial trained skill you gained during character creation.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<p>You can change a class feature that required a choice, making a different choice instead. This lets you change a druid order or a wizard school, for example. The GM will tell you how long this takes-always at least a month.</p>",

If the object is in a pocket or similarly protected, you take a -5 penalty to your Thievery check. The GM might increase the DC of your check if the nature of the object makes it harder to steal (such as a very small item in a large pack, or a sheet of parchment mixed in with other documents).</p>\n<p>You might also need to compare your Thievery check result against the Perception DCs of observers other than the person wearing the object.
